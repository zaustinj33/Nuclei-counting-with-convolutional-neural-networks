# Nuclei-counting-with-convolutional-neural-networks

A program to count nuclei based on submissions to the Kaggle Data Science Bowl in 2018.
Code chunks are derived from user-submitted tutorials, however my own thought is used to generate a cohesive pipeline to
process the data.

Input: 2 folders containing training and test images of nuclei from varieties of image sources (immunohistochemistry, immunofluoresence etc)
Output: Masks of images used for nucluei counts, counts files, and a scoring metric for the convolutional network.
